# Tennis Game Scoring

This is a solution to the Tennis Game Scoring Problem using PHP. 

## Requirements
You are required to have PHP 7.1 or higher installed on the command line you can check this by running the following command.

```bash 
php -v
```

If it is not installed instructions on how to install for your system can be found here: https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php

Composer was also used to install PHPUnit. For purposes of this task it has been included with the project in the ```./vendor``` directory, usually this directory would not be included with the source code. If the tests don't run you may also have to install composer (https://getcomposer.org/) and run the following command.

```bash
composer install
```

## Usage
If PHP is correctly installed you should be able to run the following in order to run the tests.

```bash 
php ./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox tests
```
